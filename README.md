# Data Analysis Pipeline
Goal: Create a generic pipeline that can clean, explore, visualize, perform statistical analysic, and create ML models on a wide range of datasets and sources.

Short Term TODO:
 - Cleaning: 
    - Add transformations, scaling, normalizing.
    - Add encoding (frequency, one-hot, label)
    - Test class methods
    - Add error handling
    - Create unit tests

Next Milestones:
 - Statistical Analysis
 - ML Models & Evaluation
 - Visualizations
